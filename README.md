### Hi, I am Jiawei Zhou 👋

📖 I am a third-year PhD student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), advised by Prof. Lei Chen. 

💻 Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in the area of **natural language processing** and **self-supervised learning**. 
Additionally, I am fascinated by the concepts of collective consciousness and human-in-the-loop.

❤️ Besides research, I also like swimming 🏊‍♂️, board games 👾, and cocktails 🍹.

📭 If you have any questions to discuss or interests in collaboration, please feel free to reach out!
